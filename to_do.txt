Main Idea is  -> Historical Trends 

Choosing "Historical stock market crashes"

Dataset selection -> Have to find Kaggle or Stock based dataset, if we cannot find the appropriate dataset we can formulate our own dataset.

1. select crashes

2. Finding types of viz ideas to ideate for these crashes to understand analytically what is happening. 

3. Design -> Timeline at bottom ("Crash based timeline"), Will show multple types of different graph assocaited during that time peroid. 
             Create a homepage which has ->  Map, Time line slider, Global Analysis
             Selecting a particular Stock exchange -> 3 different sets of analysis, Time line slider, back button to main timeline
             Extra - including year based timeline instead of crash based timeline.
